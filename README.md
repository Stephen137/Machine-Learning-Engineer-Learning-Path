# Machine-Learning-Engineer-Learning-Path
A curated collection of on-demand courses, labs, and skill badges that provide real-world, hands-on experience using Google Cloud technologies essential to the ML Engineer role.

## Introduction to AI and Machine Learning on Google Cloud
This course introduces the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offerings on Google Cloud that support the data-to-AI lifecycle through AI foundations, AI development, and AI solutions. It explores the technologies, products, and tools available to build an ML model, an ML pipeline, and a generative AI project based on the different goals of users, including data scientists, AI developers, and ML engineers.

## Launching into Machine Learning
The course begins with a discussion about data: how to improve data quality and perform exploratory data analysis. We describe Vertex AI AutoML and how to build, train, and deploy an ML model without writing a single line of code. You will understand the benefits of Big Query ML. We then discuss how to optimize a machine learning (ML) model and how generalization and sampling can help assess the quality of ML models for custom training.

## TensorFlow on Google Cloud
This course covers designing and building a TensorFlow input data pipeline, building ML models with TensorFlow and Keras, improving the accuracy of ML models, writing ML models for scaled use, and writing specialized ML models.

## Feature Engineering
This course explores the benefits of using Vertex AI Feature Store, how to improve the accuracy of ML models, and how to find which data columns make the most useful features. This course also includes content and labs on feature engineering using BigQuery ML, Keras, and TensorFlow.

## Machine Learning in the Enterprise
This course takes a real-world approach to the ML Workflow through a case study. An ML team faces several ML business requirements and use cases. The team must understand the tools required for data management and governance and consider the best approach for data preprocessing. The team is presented with three options to build ML models for two use cases. The course explains why they would use AutoML, BigQuery ML, or custom training to achieve their objectives.

## Production Machine Learning Systems
This course covers how to implement the various flavors of production ML systems— static, dynamic, and continuous training; static and dynamic inference; and batch and online processing. You delve into TensorFlow abstraction levels, the various options for doing distributed training, and how to write distributed training models with custom estimators.

## Computer Vision Fundamentals with Google Cloud
This course describes different types of computer vision use cases and then highlights different machine learning strategies for solving these use cases. The strategies vary from experimenting with pre-built ML models through pre-built ML APIs and AutoML Vision to building custom image classifiers using linear models, deep neural network (DNN) models or convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The course shows how to improve a model's accuracy with augmentation, feature extraction, and fine-tuning hyperparameters while trying to avoid overfitting the data. The course also looks at practical issues that arise, for example, when one doesn't have enough data and how to incorporate the latest research findings into different models. Learners will get hands-on practice building and optimizing their own image classification models on a variety of public datasets in the labs they will work on.

## Natural Language Processing on Google Cloud
This course introduces the products and solutions to solve NLP problems on Google Cloud. Additionally, it explores the processes, techniques, and tools to develop an NLP project with neural networks by using Vertex AI and TensorFlow.

## Recommendation Systems on Google Cloud
In this course, you apply your knowledge of classification models and embeddings to build a ML pipeline that functions as a recommendation engine. 

## Machine Learning Operations (MLOps): Getting Started
This course introduces participants to MLOps tools and best practices for deploying, evaluating, monitoring and operating production ML systems on Google Cloud. MLOps is a discipline focused on the deployment, testing, monitoring, and automation of ML systems in production. Machine Learning Engineering professionals use tools for continuous improvement and evaluation of deployed models. They work with (or can be) Data Scientists, who develop models, to enable velocity and rigor in deploying the best performing models.

## Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) with Vertex AI: Manage Features
This course introduces participants to MLOps tools and best practices for deploying, evaluating, monitoring and operating production ML systems on Google Cloud. MLOps is a discipline focused on the deployment, testing, monitoring, and automation of ML systems in production. Learners will get hands-on practice using Vertex AI Feature Store's streaming ingestion at the SDK layer.

## ML Pipelines on Google Cloud
In this course, you will be learning from ML Engineers and Trainers who work with the state-of-the-art development of ML pipelines here at Google Cloud. The first few modules will cover about TensorFlow Extended (or TFX), which is Google’s production machine learning platform based on TensorFlow for management of ML pipelines and metadata. You will learn about pipeline components and pipeline orchestration with TFX. You will also learn how you can automate your pipeline through continuous integration and continuous deployment, and how to manage ML metadata. Then we will change focus to discuss how we can automate and reuse ML pipelines across multiple ML frameworks such as tensorflow, pytorch, scikit learn, and xgboost. You will also learn how to use another tool on Google Cloud, Cloud Composer, to orchestrate your continuous training pipelines. And finally, we will go over how to use MLflow for managing the complete machine learning life cycle.

## Perform Foundational Data, ML, and AI Tasks in Google Cloud
Learn the basic features for the following machine learning and AI technologies: BigQuery, Cloud Speech AI, Cloud Natural Language API, AI Platform, Dataflow, Cloud Dataprep by Trifacta, Dataproc, and Video Intelligence API.

## Build and Deploy Machine Learning Solutions on Vertex AI
Learn how to use Google Cloud’s unified Vertex AI platform and its AutoML and custom training services to train, evaluate, tune, explain, and deploy machine learning solutions. The datasets and labs are built around high business impact enterprise machine learning use cases; these include retail customer lifetime value prediction, mobile game churn prediction, visual car part defection identification, and fine tuning BERT for review sentiment classification. Learners will gain hands-on experience with Vertex AI for new and existing ML workloads and be able to leverage AutoML, custom training, and new MLOps services to significantly enhance development productivity and accelerate time to value.
